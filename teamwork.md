## Teamwork Agreement

#### How you prefer to communicate (e.g., discord, whatsapp), how responsive you expect your partner to be (e.g., respond the same day), and how responsive you will be.
- Communicate mainly through Instagram DM.
- Respond within the same day, faster responses as we come up to the deadline

#### Whether you prefer meeting in-person or online.
- Meet online during lab section regularly
- Meet in person for urgent tasks closer to deadline

#### Your work style.  For example, whether you like to get your work done early, or leave tasks closer to the deadline.
- Start early, plan everything out, and split up the work
- Get work done a few days before deadline to review

#### Whether you expect to have any weekly meetings outside of lab, and at what time.
- Meetings outside of lab if needed
- Times we are free to meet:
    - Wednesdays 12:30-4:00pm
    - Tuesdays Thurs 11:00am-2:00pm
    - Mon or Fri after 5:00pm

#### The frequency you will push your work to GitHub and open pull requests. In particular, reflect on what a "unit of work" means to you and how you will know it is ready to be reviewed by your partner.
- Depending on task, when we finish a full implementation of a component
- Send message on Instagram for review
